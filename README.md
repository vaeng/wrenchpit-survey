## Challenge to create a survey form
This was my second web project to gain some footing with css and html. No scripts, no preprocessors.

## What is special?
Most time consuming where the custom checkboxes, radiobuttons and the custom dropdown arrow. I could not figure out how to change the arrows in the number input. So I removed it.
